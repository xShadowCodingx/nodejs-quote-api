# Quote Generator

This documentation covers the **NodeJS Quote API** and its different features and functions. This README is separated into different sections, to better organize the information within it. My goal is a full-fledged API, with full-use functionality.

## Schema


### Quotes

The quotes inside of */quotes/Quotes.json* are generated by AI.

### Utilities

Inside of */utilities*, you can find the following files:

- **quote_util.js**: Utility class, with methods for handling the JSON data inside of the *Quotes.json*.

- - *getQuotes*: Parses the Quotes.json file, and returns the JSON string
- - *getRandomCategory*: Chooses a random category, there are 7 categories and it randomly picks a number between 1 and 7, assigning the categories depending on which number is chosen. Then it returns the category string to be used when picking a quote.
- - *getRandomQuote*: Chooses a random quote, using the quote JSON string and the category as a parameter.

### Endpoints

The different endpoints return different information based on which one is used. They are imported and used within *index.js* in the root directory.

- **/api/quote/random**: Returns the JSON value of a random quote. This would have to be parsed on the front-end.
- **api/quote/motivational**: Returns the JSON value of a random motivational quote. This would have to be parsed on the front-end.
- **api/quote/work**: Returns the JSON value of a random work quote. This would have to be parsed on the front-end.
- **api/quote/life**: Returns the JSON value of a random life quote. This would have to be parsed on the front-end.
- **api/quote/love**: Returns the JSON value of a random love quote. This would have to be parsed on the front-end.
- **api/quote/happiness**: Returns the JSON value of a random happiness quote. This would have to be parsed on the front-end.
- **api/quote/family**: Returns the JSON value of a random family quote. This would have to be parsed on the front-end.
- **api/quote/funny**: Returns the JSON value of a random funny quote. This would have to be parsed on the front-end.
